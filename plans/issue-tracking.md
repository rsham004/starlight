## GitHub Issue Labels

The following labels have been created for categorizing issues:

- **bug** - Something isn't working
- **enhancement** - New feature or request
- **documentation** - Improvements or additions to documentation
- **planning** - Planning and design tasks
- **implementation** - Implementation tasks
- **testing** - Testing related tasks
- **discovery** - Issues discovered during development

## Process for Raising Issues

### When to Create an Issue

1. **Bugs Found** - Any unexpected behavior or errors
2. **Feature Ideas** - New functionality to be added

4. **Documentation Gaps** - Missing or unclear documentation
5. **Planning Tasks** - Design decisions that need discussion

### Issue Creation Guidelines

1. **Title** - Clear, concise description of the issue
2. **Description** - Include:

   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Relevant code snippets or error messages
3. **Labels** - Apply appropriate labels from the list above
4. **Assignees** - Assign to relevant team members if known
