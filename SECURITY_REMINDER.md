# ðŸ”’ Security Reminder

## Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT**: The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials and is already protected by `.gitignore`.

### What's Protected:
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Never commit this to version control
- All environment variables in `.env` file

### Security Checklist:
- âœ… `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- âœ… Secret key is only in local `.env` file
- âœ… Publishable key is safe to expose (starts with `pk_`)

### For Production:
- Set environment variables directly in your hosting platform
- Never commit `.env.production` with real secrets
- Use your hosting platform's environment variable settings

### Current Setup:
- Publishable Key: `pk_test_YWN0dWFsLWRyYWtlLTgyLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ` (safe to share)
- Secret Key: Protected in `.env` file (never commit to git)
