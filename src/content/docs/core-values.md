# 🌟 Our Core Values

At Product Foundry, we’re here to build with purpose, learn fast, and grow together. These principles guide how we show up and collaborate — in code, in conversation, and in community.

| Value | Description |
|----|----|
| **✅ Keep It Real, Keep It Useful** | We're here to build and learn. Share what works. Skip the fluff. |
| **🗣️ Be Direct, Not Dismissive** | Challenge ideas, not egos. We get better by testing assumptions — together. |
| **🧵 Stay on Thread** | Side quests are fine — just call them what they are and park them if they risk derailing the core flow. |
| **🎙 Own Your Voice, Make Space for Others** | Speak up when you’ve got something to add. Step back when someone else needs airtime. |
| **🧱 Respect the Stack** | Whether it’s tech or people — understand what’s already in place before proposing a rebuild. |
| **🚢 Progress Beats Perfection** | Ship something. Improve it. Don’t wait for the perfect plan to start moving. |
| **🤝 Don’t Code in a Cave** | Share early. Share rough. It’s how we learn fast and avoid dead ends. |
| **🧠 Context Over Credentials** | Don’t posture — explain. A good idea should stand on clarity, not job titles. |
| **🤍 Assume Good Intent, But Call the Gaps** | We trust each other — and we name what’s not working. That’s how trust grows. |
| **📝 Document What Matters** | If it’s a decision, a fix, or a pattern others might hit — leave a breadcrumb. |

These values aren’t rules — they’re signals. Use them to stay aligned, stay curious, and stay building.
