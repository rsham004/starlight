# üèóÔ∏è The Foundry Operating System v2.1

> *Document Purpose:*  
This document distills the truths, rhythms, and practices that guide the Product Foundry ecosystem.  
It exists to help us build the tools, knowledge, and culture that will shape the future‚Äîtogether.

---

## 1. Core Mission & Philosophy

The **AI Builders Group (ABG)** is the collaborative engine of the Product Foundry ecosystem.  
It is not a passive audience; it is an active **foundry** ‚Äî a place where members co-create real solutions to real challenges.

Through shared purpose, decentralized leadership, and iterative experimentation, we build together.  
Participation is not about perfection; it is about **presence**.  
Every contribution matters. Every voice helps shape the whole.

> This is a foundry, not a stage. Show up. Shape it.

**A short note for new members:**  
Welcome! The best way to start is to observe one full sprint cycle to get a feel for the rhythm.  
At the start of the next cycle, you can nominate yourself for a working group that interests you.

---

## 2. The Meeting Cadence: 6-Week Sprints

To provide a predictable and productive rhythm, the ABG operates in **6-week sprint cycles**.  
This cadence gives the group time to build trust, iterate meaningfully, and renew its creative energy without burnout.

At the end of each sprint, we host a **Sprint Retrospective & Showcase** ‚Äî celebrating progress, gathering feedback, and surfacing the next set of challenges. This creates a clear punctuation mark and reinforces collective momentum.

---

## 3. The Weekly Ritual: 90 Minutes of Creation

This format is designed to **minimize passive listening** and **maximize active participation**.

**Part I: All-Hands Sync (15 mins)**  
- *Welcome & Framing (5 mins):* Brief welcome from the session's Convener, setting the intention.  
- *Lightning Share (10 mins):* Each working group lead shares one breakthrough or blocker from the past week.

**Part II: Working Group Breakouts (60 mins)**  
- Members join their pre-committed working groups to collaborate on their specific challenge.

**Part III: Report-Back & Closing (15 mins)**  
- *Report-Back (10 mins):* Each group gives a rapid summary of their progress.  
- *Optional Spotlight (5 mins):* A nominated group shares a demo, lesson, or tool.  
- *Feedback + Closing Ritual:* Reflections and feedback.

> üï∞Ô∏è *Accessibility Note:* If you cannot attend live due to time-zone or other constraints, async contribution via group chat or Loom video is fully valid and welcome.

## 4. Tiered Challenge Design

To promote inclusivity and match skill levels, challenges are **tiered**.  
The community maintains a **living Challenge Library**, which all members can contribute to.

| Tier | Scope | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| **1. Quick Wins** | Fast, useful contributions | Prompt libraries, documentation, micro-tools |
| **2. Deep Builds** | Sustained collaborative development | RAG frameworks, internal agents |
| **3. Moonshots** | Experimental or breakthrough ideas | Autonomous agents, novel toolchains |

---

## 5. Leadership & Support Structure

**Circle Leads:**  
- Volunteer-based, mentored by the core team  
- Supported with the ‚ÄúCircle Lead Guide‚Äù  
- Expected to attend the Weekly Lead Sync

**Weekly Lead Sync (15 mins max):**  
- *Format:* Live call or async via Loom/chat  
- *Purpose:* Surface blockers, celebrate breakthroughs, cross-pollinate ideas  
- *Facilitation:* Rotating host to share ownership

**Convener:**  
The **Convener** is the rotating facilitator for the Weekly Ritual.  
Default is a Core Team member, but can be delegated to experienced Circle Leads.
