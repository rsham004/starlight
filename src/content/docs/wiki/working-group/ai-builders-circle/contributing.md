# ✍️ How to Contribute to the Wiki

This wiki is a living knowledge base — and it only grows because people like you take the time to share what they know.

Whether you're fixing a typo, writing up a how-to, or documenting a hard-earned lesson — your contributions help everyone move faster and smarter.

## 🧭 Where to Start

Here are a few great ways to jump in:

- 🔧 **Fix or clarify an existing page**  
  Found something outdated or unclear? Hit edit and make it better.

- 📚 **Write up something you’ve learned**  
  Did you figure out a workflow, tool, or trick others might benefit from? Document it!

- 🗺 **Add structure**  
  Help us organize topics into categories or suggest new sections that make the wiki easier to navigate.

- 🔁 **Refactor**  
  Combine duplicate pages, clean up formatting, or rewrite confusing sections — clarity is a gift.

## 🛠️ Editing Guidelines

- **Be concise and clear** — aim for usefulness, not verbosity.
- **Link generously** — connect related pages and external resources.
- **Use headings** to break up content and make scanning easier.
- **Add examples** — real-world context makes things easier to grasp.
- **Include a date** if a process might go out of date quickly.

## 🧪 For First-Time Editors

1. Head to any page and click **Edit** (pencil icon).
2. Make your changes in Markdown.
3. Save your update with a short summary of what you changed.
4. That’s it! 🎉
