# 🛡️ Contribution & IP Protocol

We believe in **transparent contribution** and **shared ownership**.  
The work you create here should help you **grow**, **be seen**, and **be protected**.

---

## 🧾 Contribution Tracker

We use a lightweight, **opt-in public tracker** to record project involvement and personal contributions.  
This serves two purposes:
- 🎖️ **Recognition** – highlight your efforts and breakthroughs
- 📄 **Resume Builder** – showcase your work with real-world impact

---

## ⚖️ IP & Licensing Principles

- ✍️ Contributors **always retain credit and attribution** for their work.  
- 🤝 Core IP is shared with the **Product Foundry community** under a license that encourages collaboration and fair use.
- 💼 Commercial use by **BlueHarbour.AI** or affiliated ventures will follow **shared-benefit principles**, which may include:
  - Revenue share  
  - Equity  
  - Formal partnership recognition for major contributors

---

## 📜 Ethics Clause

All contributions and projects must align with our **core values** of:
- Inclusion  
- Transparency  
- Responsible and ethical use of AI

Disputes will be:
1. First **mediated by the relevant Circle Leads**
2. If unresolved, **escalated to the Core Team** for a final, documented decision

---

By contributing here, you help shape a future that’s open, fair, and built in good faith. Thank you.
