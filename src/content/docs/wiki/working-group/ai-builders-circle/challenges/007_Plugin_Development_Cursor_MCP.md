## 🧠 Problem Statement

Develop plugins for Cursor IDE using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend functionality and improve developer experience.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build **custom plugins for Cursor IDE** that leverage MCP capabilities to enhance development workflows and productivity.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Working plugin that integrates with Cursor IDE
- Utilizes MCP for enhanced AI-assisted development features
- Clear documentation for plugin installation and usage
- Reusable plugin architecture for future extensions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Inputs

- IDE: Cursor IDE
- Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript
- APIs: Cursor extension APIs, MCP specifications
- Tools: Node.js, npm/yarn, VS Code extension development tools

## 📦 Suggested Architecture

```plaintext
[Plugin Core] → [MCP Integration]
   ↓
[Cursor API] → [Feature Implementation]
   ↓
[User Interface] → [Configuration Management]
   ↓
[Testing & Validation] → [Distribution]
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **Plugin Framework**: Set up basic plugin structure for Cursor IDE
2. **MCP Integration**: Implement Model Context Protocol communication
3. **Feature Development**: Build specific functionality (code analysis, suggestions, etc.)
4. **UI Components**: Create user interface elements within Cursor
5. **Configuration System**: Allow users to customize plugin behavior
6. **Testing Suite**: Validate plugin functionality and compatibility

## 💬 Discussion Prompts

- What specific functionality would be most valuable for Cursor users?
- How can we best leverage MCP capabilities for enhanced AI assistance?
- What are the key challenges in Cursor plugin development?
- How should we handle plugin updates and version management?

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This plugin development will:
- Extend Cursor IDE capabilities beyond default features
- Demonstrate practical MCP implementation
- Improve developer productivity and experience
- Create reusable patterns for future plugin development
- Contribute to the Cursor ecosystem
