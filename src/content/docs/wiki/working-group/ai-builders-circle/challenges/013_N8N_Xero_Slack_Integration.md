## Problem Statement

Create automated workflows using N8N that integrate Xero accounting software with Slack for real-time financial notifications and streamlined business operations.

---

## Goal

Build **comprehensive N8N workflows** that connect Xero financial data with Slack communications to automate financial reporting and notifications.

---

## Success Criteria

- Automated financial alerts and notifications in Slack channels
- Real-time invoice and payment status updates
- Expense approval workflows through Slack interactions
- Automated financial reporting and dashboard updates
- Integration with team collaboration and decision-making processes

---

## Tech Stack & Inputs

- Workflow Automation: N8N
- Accounting Software: Xero API
- Communication Platform: Slack API, Slack Bot framework
- Data Processing: JSON manipulation, data transformation
- Notifications: Slack webhooks, direct messages, channel posts
- Scheduling: N8N cron triggers, webhook triggers

## Suggested Architecture

```plaintext
[Xero Events] → [N8N Webhook/Polling]
   ↓
[Data Processing] → [Business Logic]
   ↓
[Notification Formatting] → [Slack API Integration]
   ↓
[Channel/User Targeting] → [Message Delivery]
   ↓
[Response Handling] → [Follow-up Actions]
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **Xero Monitor**: Track changes in invoices, payments, expenses, and reports
2. **Event Processor**: Parse and categorize financial events
3. **Business Rules Engine**: Apply conditional logic for different scenarios
4. **Slack Formatter**: Create appropriate message formats for different channels
5. **Notification Router**: Send messages to relevant teams and individuals
6. **Interactive Handler**: Process Slack button clicks and responses
7. **Follow-up Automation**: Trigger additional workflows based on responses

**Workflow Examples:**
- New invoice created → Notify sales team in #sales channel
- Payment overdue → Alert accounts receivable team with action buttons
- Large expense submitted → Send approval request to managers
- Monthly financial summary → Post dashboard to #finance channel
