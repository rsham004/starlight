# Challenge Library Overview

Welcome to the **Challenge Library** - the heart of our hands-on learning and innovation engine.

This is where ideas become missions. Every challenge listed here is an opportunity to build, learn, and contribute alongside others. Whether you're picking up your first quick win or diving into a moonshot, this library helps you find the right fit.

---

## What Is a Challenge?

A **challenge** is a focused problem or opportunity that a working group can explore in a 6-week sprint.  
Each one is designed to encourage experimentation, learning, and real-world outcomes.

Challenges vary in size, scope, and complexity -- and that's by design.

| **2. Deep Builds** | Sustained collaborative development | RAG frameworks, internal agents |
| **3. Moonshots** | Experimental or breakthrough ideas | Autonomous agents, novel toolchains |

Each challenge includes:
- A problem statement or opportunity
- Relevant background or context
- Suggested outputs or success criteria

## Why This Matters

The Challenge Library reflects our collective curiosity and ambition.  
It's not just a to-do list -- it's a record of what we care about, where we're growing, and how we collaborate.

Let's build the future, one challenge at a time.
