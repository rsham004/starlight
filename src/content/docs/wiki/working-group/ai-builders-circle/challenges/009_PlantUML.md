## 🧠 Problem Statement

Implement PlantUML integration for automated diagram generation and documentation visualization across development workflows.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a **comprehensive PlantUML workflow** that enables automated diagram generation, integration with documentation systems, and seamless visualization of system architectures.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Automated PlantUML diagram generation from code or specifications
- Integration with documentation platforms (Wiki.js, GitBook, etc.)
- Real-time diagram preview and editing capabilities
- Template library for common diagram types
- Export capabilities to multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Inputs

- Diagram Engine: PlantUML server, local PlantUML installation
- Integration: VS Code extensions, web-based editors
- Documentation: Wiki.js, GitBook, Markdown processors
- Automation: GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines
- Export Formats: PNG, SVG, PDF, ASCII art

## 📦 Suggested Architecture

```plaintext
[PlantUML Source] → [Diagram Processor]
   ↓
[Template Engine] → [Rendering Service]
   ↓
[Format Converter] → [Documentation Integration]
   ↓
[Version Control] → [Publication/Display]
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **Source Management**: Organize and version PlantUML source files
2. **Processing Engine**: Convert PlantUML syntax to visual diagrams
3. **Template System**: Provide reusable diagram templates and styles
4. **Integration Layer**: Connect with documentation and development tools
5. **Export System**: Generate diagrams in multiple output formats
6. **Automation Pipeline**: Automatically update diagrams when source changes

**Diagram Types to Support:**
- Sequence diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Use case diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- Component diagrams
- Deployment diagrams

---

## 💬 Discussion Prompts

- Which diagram types are most valuable for our documentation needs?
- How should we handle diagram versioning and change tracking?
- What level of automation is appropriate for diagram updates?
- How can we ensure diagram consistency across different projects?

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This PlantUML implementation will:
- Standardize diagram creation across projects
- Enable version-controlled visual documentation
- Reduce time spent on manual diagram creation and updates
- Improve system architecture communication
- Create reusable visualization assets
