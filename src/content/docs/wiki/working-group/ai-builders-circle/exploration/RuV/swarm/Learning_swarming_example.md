I hit rate limit very very swiftly so I am going on to investigate opencode

Questions - when I hit the rate limit the code space stopped due to inactivity how do I go back to codespace and continue the swarm?

**Project Objective** :

Create a learning platform with gated content with the following modules

# Learning Path: Swarm Coordination Mastery

## Beginner Level (Estimated: 4 hours)
1. **Basic Swarm Setup** (30 min)
   - Install and configure ruv-swarm
   - Initialize your first swarm
   - Basic agent coordination

2. **Memory Management** (45 min)
   - Understand persistent memory
   - Store and retrieve coordination data
   - Cross-session memory usage

3. **Simple SPARC Workflow** (1 hour)
   - Basic SPARC methodology
   - Agent-assisted specification
   - Collaborative implementation

## Intermediate Level (Estimated: 8 hours)
1. **Neural Pattern Integration** (2 hours)
   - Understand neural thinking patterns
   - Apply convergent and divergent patterns
   - Optimize workflows with AI insights

2. **Topology Optimization** (2 hours)
   - Compare topology performance
   - Dynamic topology adaptation
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Advanced SPARC Modes** (2 hours)
   - Multi-agent SPARC coordination
   - Adaptive mode selection
   - Performance-driven optimization

## Advanced Level (Estimated: 12 hours)
1. **Custom Integration Development** (4 hours)
   - Build custom MCP tools
   - Extend neural patterns
   - Create domain-specific workflows

2. **Enterprise Deployment** (4 hours)
   - Scale coordination systems
   - Security and compliance
   - Performance optimization

3. **Contributing to the Ecosystem** (4 hours)
   - Develop new neural patterns
   - Contribute example projects
   - Mentor community members
