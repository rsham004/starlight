This is where we document our sprint sessions, community syncs, retrospectives, and working group updates.

Good documentation helps us:
- Track decisions
- Recognize contributions
- Surface learnings
- Onboard new members quickly

---

## 📅 Naming Convention

All meeting notes follow the **`YYYY-MM-DD`** format (e.g., `2025-07-05.md`), so they:
- Sort chronologically
- Stay consistent across folders
- Can be linked easily in retros or summaries

Files should be saved in the `meetings/` directory (or subfolders like `sprints/`, `syncs/`, or `leads/` depending on your structure).
